# Alcohol Detection System Using IoT
Welcome to the Alcohol Detection System project repository! This project involves building a system that detects alcohol levels using an MQ135 sensor and prevents the car
motor driver from working if the alcohol level is above a threshold. An IR sensor is used to detect the presence of a person, and an ESP8266 microcontroller is used to 
control the system and display data on a 16x2 I2C LCD screen.

## Components Used
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **MQ135 Gas Sensor**
- **IR Sensor**
- **16x2 I2C LCD Screen**
- **Motor Driver**
- **Breadboard**

## Software
- **Arduino IDE**: Used to write, compile, and upload the code to the ESP8266 board.

## Project Structure
- **Code**: Arduino code responsible for detecting the presence of a person, checking the alcohol level, and controlling the motor driver based on the alcohol level.
- **Project Photographs**: Images showing the setup of the components.
- **Diagram**: A visual representation of the circuit
